I need dynamic algorithm to be used to find the k central nodes of the network.
My work is an extension to 'Computing top-k Closeness Centrality Faster
in Unweighted Graphs' this research paper by ELISABETTA BERGAMINI
So from the input graph containing many nodes, the code should display set of nodes most central to the whole network.
Also it should dynamically change with the network
Also the output should display the routing table of the selected k central nodes
My guide wants the implementation of the paper but it will be applicable only on small networks
So he wants dynamic algorithm to be implemented in it so that it can work on large networks with good efficiency

Please tell me if it is doable for you?
